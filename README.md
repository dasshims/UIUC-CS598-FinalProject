## Steps to run the code

To execute the code locally, first clone the git repo -
```bash
https://github.com/dasshims/UIUC-CS598-FinalProject.git

```

Open the folder to an IDE, VSCode preferred

Open the ipynb file and set the python interpreter to 3.x.x, for our project we used 3.9.6

## Requirements

CPU: A multi-core processor with sufficient computational power for training machine learning models. A CPU with at least 4 cores and a clock speed of 2.5 GHz or higher is recommended.

RAM: Adequate RAM to handle the dataset size and model training. A minimum of 8 GB RAM is recommended for handling the preprocessing and training tasks efficiently.
